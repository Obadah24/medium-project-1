### in brief about the medium project about Booking a tabel in The little lemon restaurant.The application consists of serveral pages and many components which helps to improve your skills in React.js and also i used the Chakra UI library for styling and Formik for form management.

# The Application is just Responsive with Moblie and Disktop.

# Apps.js

1. i was importing the required modules from the react-router-dom library. These modules are createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, Route, and RouterProvider. These modules will be used to define and configure the routing and navigation of the application.
2. i was importing the required layouts and pages of the application. These layouts and pages will be used to render the different components based on the current URL path.
3. i was creating the router and routes for the application using the createBrowserRouter and createRoutesFromElements modules. We define the root route with path="/", which renders the RootLayout component. Then, we define child routes for the root route, such as index for the Home component, about for the About component, and so on.
4. i was defining the App component, which returns the RouterProvider component. The RouterProvider component is responsible for providing the router to the application, which we created in the previous step.
5. Exporting the App Component

# Index.html

1. <!DOCTYPE html> declares that this document is an HTML5 document.
2. <html lang="en"> opens the HTML document and sets the language to English.
3. <head> starts the head section of the document, which contains metadata about the document.
4. <meta charset="UTF-8" /> specifies the character encoding of the document as UTF-8, which supports all Unicode characters.
5. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> sets the viewport width to the device width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0. This ensures that the website is displayed properly on mobile devices.
6. <meta name="description" content="A restaurant has delicious classic and modern meals" /> provides a short description of the restaurant that will be displayed in search engine results.
7. <meta name="og:title" content="Our Menu" /> sets the title of the website that will be displayed in social media previews.
8. <meta name="og:description" content="creating a table booking form for the Little Lemon website" /> provides a brief description of the website that will be displayed in social media previews.
9. <meta name="og:image" content="./img/Logo .svg" /> sets the URL of the image that will be displayed in social media previews.
10. <meta name="og:type" content="website"> sets the type of the website that will be displayed in social media previews.
11. <meta name="author" content="Little Lemon Restaurant"> provides the name of the author of the website.
12. <title>Little lemon Restaurant</title> sets the title of the HTML document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar and in search engine results.
13. </head> ends the head section of the document.
14. <body> starts the body section of the document, which contains the visible content of the website.
15. <script type="module" src="/src/index.js"></script> references a JavaScript file that will be loaded and executed by the browser. The type="module" attribute indicates that the script is a module that can import and export code. The src attribute specifies the URL of the JavaScript file.

# RootLayout.js

- i was importing the Outlet component from the react-router-dom library. Outlet is a special component that is used in nested routes to render the child components of a parent route.

# pages:

- Home.js

1. i was imports the core React library which provides features and tools for building web applications using React
2. this code that renders multiple other components such as NavBar, CallToAction, Specials, CustomersSay, Dubai, and Footer. The purpose of this component is to render the home page of a web application.

- Rservations.js

1 The first line imports the React library, which is required to use React in the code. 2. The next few lines import various components from different files, including the NavBar, HeroReservation, BookingPage, Alert, AlertProvider, and Footer components. 3. The function Reservations is defined using the export default syntax, which means that this function can be used in other files that import this module. 4. The Reservations function returns a JSX expression, which is wrapped in an empty fragment <> </> to group together multiple JSX elements.
Within the fragment. 5. the AlertProvider component is used to provide a context to its child components. This context can be used to manage the state and pass data between different components.

# Components:

- NavBar.js

1. The first line imports the React library, which is required to use React in the code.
2. The next line imports the FontAwesomeIcon component from the @fortawesome/react-fontawesome package. This component is used to display icons from the Font Awesome library.
3. The faList icon is imported from the @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons package. This is one of the many free icons provided by Font Awesome.
4. The Link component is imported from the react-router-dom package. This component is used to create links to different pages within the web application.
5. The Box, Container, Flex, Image, Menu, MenuButton, MenuItem, MenuList, and useMediaQuery components are imported from the @chakra-ui/react package. This package provides a set of customizable UI components for React.
6. The NavBar function is defined using the export default syntax, which means that this function can be used in other files that import this module.
7. The useMediaQuery hook is used to check if the screen width is smaller than 1024 pixels. This hook returns a boolean value that can be used to conditionally render different parts of the navigation bar based on the screen size.
8. The NavLink function is defined with two parameters, path and label. This function creates a navigation link with a label and a URL path.
9. The Link component is used to create the actual navigation link. This component takes a to attribute that specifies the URL path that the link will navigate to.
10. The path parameter is used as the value of the to attribute, which is the URL path that the link will navigate to when clicked.

- note: why have i used this NavLink function ?
  Yes, the code you provided is an example of a component in React that uses composition to build its UI.
- The component NavLink is composed of two other components: Box and Link. It takes two props, path and label, and uses them to build a Link element with the specified path and label, which is then wrapped inside a Box element that adds some additional styling.

- This is a common pattern in React development, where components are composed of smaller, reusable components to create more complex UIs. By breaking down UIs into smaller, composable pieces, developers can create more flexible and maintainable code.

- CutomerCard.js

1. First, a new component called FontAwesomeIconRate is defined using an arrow function syntax. This component takes a single prop name.
2. Inside the FontAwesomeIconRate function, a new object called ratings is defined. This object contains a few key-value pairs
3. Next, the rating variable is set equal to the value of the name key in the ratings object. If the name is not found in the ratings object, the function returns null.
4. If the name is found in the ratings object, the function returns an array of FontAwesomeIcon components.
5. The array is created using the Array constructor and the rating value. This creates a new array with rating number of empty elements.
6. The fill() method is called on the array, which fills each empty element with undefined.
7. The map() method is then called on the array, which creates a new array of FontAwesomeIcon components.
8. The map() method takes a callback function that is called for each element in the array. In this case, the callback function takes two arguments: \_ (a placeholder for the current element) and index(the index of the current element).
9. Finally, the new array of FontAwesomeIcon components is wrapped in a React fragment (<>...</>) and returned from the FontAwesomeIconRate function.

- note: some benefits of using a fragment over a <div>:

1. Fragments don't create an extra DOM node, which can help with performance and avoid potential issues with CSS styles.
2. Fragments can help keep your code cleaner and easier to read by avoiding the need for unnecessary wrapper elements.
3. Fragments can be used to return multiple children from a component without requiring an enclosing element, which can be helpful in some cases.

- Footer.js
- The FooterLink component can be used to create a styled link with an icon and label, which can be conditionally styled based on whether it is currently active.
  The component takes in several props:

1. to is a string representing the URL to link to.
2. label is a string representing the text label of the link.
3. icon is a component representing the icon to display next to the label.
4. isActive is a boolean indicating whether the link is currently active.
5. onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave are optional event handlers for when the user hovers over or leaves the link.
